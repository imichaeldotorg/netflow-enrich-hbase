# Netflow Enrichment to Hbase

This is a final project for a class I took in grad school.  The project built out a workflow to ingest, process, enrich, and store netflow data.  

*This project is unmaintained and likely is using outdated and insecure dependencies.*

The project is runnable in `docker-compose`.

There is a video walk-through of this project on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAwTKpTtVek.
